Work to be done:
  - Testing - Testing the application has proven somewhat difficult in regards to test javascript asynchronous       behaviour, an attempt was made using Jest but I could not get the test passing.
  As it stands the app works fine and it probably won't be needing tests as it is very basic. Should I add more features in the future and add complexity to the application it would need to be tested driven in order to be able to maintain the product on a long-term basis.
